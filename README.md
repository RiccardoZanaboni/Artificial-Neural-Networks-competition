# Artificial-Neural-Networks-competition
*Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning* is a course offered by Politecnico di Milano. In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and @FeBD8 to partecipate at the competition in that academic year (2021/2022).

The competition was divided into Two challenges, each one of them cover a different topic of the course:
 - Image Classification
 - Time series forectasting


 
# Image Classification
We were required to classify images of leaves (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal was to predict the correct class label.

Before creatinf the Neural Netowrk for classification we first divided the dataset given with around 17000 images of 14 classes of leaves into three directory : *training, validation and test* with a ratio of *0.8, 0.1 and 0.1*

# Time series forecasting
We were required to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The goal was to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future.
