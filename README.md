# Artificial-Neural-Networks-competition
*Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning* is a course offered by Politecnico di Milano. In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and @FeBD8 to partecipate in the competition that academic year (2021/2022).

The competition was divided into two challenges, each covering a different course topic:
 - Image Classification
 - Time series forectasting


 
# Image Classification
We were asked to classify images of leaves (such as those in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Since this is a classification problem, given an image, the goal was to predict the correct class label

Before creating the neural network for classification, we divided the dataset of about 17000 images of 14 leaf classes into three directories: *training, validation and testing* with a ratio of *0.8, 0.1 and 0.1*.

# Time series forecasting
We needed to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The goal was to design and implement prediction models to learn how to exploit past observations of the input sequence to correctly predict the future.
